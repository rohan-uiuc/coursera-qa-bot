  3D Printing Revolution Syllabus
 </h1>
 <h2 level="2">
  Course Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  3D printing is exploding in popularity. Many people believe it will revolutionize our economy in many ways. In the coming years, 3D printing will change the way we live and alter the relation between firms and customers. In this course, we will explore this technology and examine its revolutionary impact. You will learn how 3D printers work, the type of things they can make, and how you can use this technology as an entrepreneur, business person, and consumer. We'll employ a variety of learning techniques, including video lectures, case studies, and interviews with 3D printing experts. Our learning approach will be highly interactive; you will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of hands-on activities and imagine a 3D printable object that you can make. I hope you will join us in this exploration.
