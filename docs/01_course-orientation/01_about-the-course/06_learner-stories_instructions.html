  When I came to learn about this course, I immediately enrolled. I am really interested in 3d printing and I have also  published a few research papers. This course help me learn more about the 3D printing services which I  was not aware of.  I give 10/10 to this  course. It was amazing and I am enrolling for the next.

  Thank you Aric! I enjoyed your class very much. All the content was very  easy to understand and follow. I love the fact that I can pick up the  materials on my phone or table through the app! Is very convenient.  Before this class I had no idea 3D printing had been around for so long,  I thought it was newer, it's amazing to see all the different  applications it can be used for.

  Thank you so much for introducing me to the world of 3D printing in the  course "The 3D Printing Revolution."  The course was fascinating and  inspirational. Looking forward to the next course.

  I'd like to express my gratitude and appreciation to you, for helping me  getting started in the 3D printing world. Honestly, I took this course  out of curiosity, because I wanted to know how 3D printing work, now  after completing this course I feel that I have a solid base of  knowledge about this technology, I loved the most about this course is  your ability to deliver us with a wide range of expertise and interviews  with the pioneers of the 3D printing world. That helped me to widen my  views on the topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a great intro to 3D Printing! I'm really looking forward to the  rest of the courses and especially the Software course.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course has helped me understand about what 3D printing is and how  it can change the world completely in the near future. I especially  loved the different interviews that Aric did with the experts in this  course. It has helped me realize the tremendous potential this  technology holds and as Aric says that It can revolutionize our economy  and the way we do business.

  This course really helped me to start more searching about 3D printing.  It gave me a lot of information, especially about other people's  experience with 3D printing and how they turned their ideas into real  products designed specially for a particular person. That's what I like  most about 3D printing, CUSTOMIZATION.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course was like a small journey for me. You visited all those  places, people and companies.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am so happy to be one of your students. I have finished this course and I feel that I am sailing in the 3d printing industry because your course  opened my eyes to take action in  this industry revolution.
