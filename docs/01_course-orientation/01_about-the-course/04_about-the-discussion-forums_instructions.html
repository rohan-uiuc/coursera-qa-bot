  Expectations
 </h2>
 <p>
  With the large number of learners in this course, no one is expected to read every post made within the discussion forums. Rather, read those that seem interesting to you and reply when you can further the conversation. Above all, you are expected to remain civil and treat all other learners with respect. Failure to do so will result in your removal from the course.

  Searching for Posts
 </h3>
 <p>
  You can search for a post by using the
  <strong>
   search box
  </strong>
  at the top of any individual forum or the
  <strong>
   All Course Discussions
  </strong>
  page. It may be helpful to see if your topic or question has already been covered before posting. If so, you can reply to that thread instead of starting a new one. You can also click on someone's name in the forums (including your own) to see all of the posts that have been made by that person.
 </p>

 </h3>
 <p>
  When you view any post, you will see an
  <strong>
   Upvote
  </strong>

The upvoting system is the best way elevate the best posts to be seen by other learners and University of Illinois staff.

  Improving Your Posts
 </h2>
 <p>
  The forums are your chance to interact with thousands of like-minded individuals on these topics. Getting their attention is one way to do well in this course. In any social interaction, certain rules of etiquette are expected and contribute to more enjoyable and productive communication. The following are tips for interacting in this course via the forums, adapted from guidelines originally compiled by AHA! and Chuq Von Rospach &amp; Gene Spafford:

 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    Search the other posts to see if your topic is already covered. If it is, reply to that thread instead of starting a new one.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Post in the most appropriate forum for your topic, and do not post the same thing in multiple forums.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Use a meaningful title for your thread.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Be civil. If you disagree, explain your position with respect and refrain from any and all personal attacks.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Stay on topic. In particular, don’t change the subject in the middle of an existing thread – just start a new topic.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Make sure you’re understood, even by non-native English speakers. Try to write full sentences, and avoid text-message abbreviations or slang. Be careful when you use humor and sarcasm as these messages are easy to misinterpret.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    If asking a question, provide as much information as possible, what you’ve already considered, what you’ve already read, etc.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Cite appropriate references when using someone else’s ideas, thoughts, or words.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Do not use a forum to promote your product, service, or business.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Do not post personal information about other posters in the forum.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Ignore spammers and report them.
