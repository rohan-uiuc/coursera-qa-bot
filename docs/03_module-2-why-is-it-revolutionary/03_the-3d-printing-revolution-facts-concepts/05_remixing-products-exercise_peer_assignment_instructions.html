  The goal of this second exercise is to give you some experience remixing objects. In essence, a digital iPhone case is really not much different than a digital iTunes song. So, now you can remix objects just as easily as you can remix music. My hope is by engaging in this remixing activity, you will gain a firsthand understanding of the revolutionary potential of 3D printing.
 </p>
 <p>
  To engage in this remixing exercise, we will be using
  <strong>
   Thingiverse
  </strong>
  . As we discussed earlier, Thingiverse is essentially an iTunes store for objects. However, in addition to downloading designs made by others, you can also remix many of these designs using its Customizer feature.

  <li>
   <p>
    Open
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">
     Thingiverse
    </a>
    and create an account if you do not already have one.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Find a Customizable design that you would like to remix (you can easily find customizable designs under the "Create" menu bar.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Click on this object.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Once it is open, click on the  "Open in Customizer" to the right of the image.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The design will show up with some menu which will allow you to change parameters for the design. This is 'Remixing'

    Save and
    <strong>

    your remixed design on Thingiverse.
    <strong>
     (Note: It may take up to 24 hours before your Thing is published).

   <p>
    On the
    <strong>
     My submission

    tab, record the Thing number for your remixed design, state why you picked this design to remix, and briefly discuss your thoughts and feeling about this remixing process.
   </p>
  </li>
