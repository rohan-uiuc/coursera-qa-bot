[MUSIC] For me, one of the cool things about
3D Printing is that the possibilities are almost endless. So, what I'm going to do
here is take this airplane which Danny Low had designed and
that we printed on our desktop 3D printer. I'm hear with Rodrigo who is
the factory manager at America Makes. And, I sent him the design. The STO file for this airplane. And, he actually took that design that
we emailed and he going to print it out. In fact, he has printed it on
this expensive [CROSSTALK] >> Very Expensive machine. >> Laser printer. >> Yes,
it's a selective laser melting burner. I know you talked about selective
laser sintering on your class. Selective laser melting refers
to a very similar machine. It just has normally a higher-end laser,
more power all of it. And you can print miles on it. So we printed it out on this machine
with very little changes to the design. And actually build all
the file inside of this. >> Let's see what comes out of the oven. >> So you can actually see
the cake of powder down there. >> [SOUND] There we have it, airplane made out of metal. >> Mm-hm. >> Thank you, great job. >> You're welcome. [MUSIC]
