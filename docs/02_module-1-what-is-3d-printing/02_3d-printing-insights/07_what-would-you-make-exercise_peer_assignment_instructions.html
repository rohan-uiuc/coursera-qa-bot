  This first exercise is designed to get you to think about making. By doing this, I am hoping to stimulate your imagination. Being able to imagine yourself as a maker is the most important aspect of the entire 3D printing process because in order to make something, you first need to imagine it.

  <strong>
   This assignment will require you to use a video camera.
  </strong>
  You can just use a web camera on your computer, but other methods are also acceptable.

 How to Record and Post Your Video
</h3>
<co-content>
 <p>
  The steps below describe how to record, upload, and submit
your video for this exercise.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you would like to keep your video private and visible
only to other learners in this course, pay special attention to steps 7 and 8. If
not, we plan to showcase some Learner stories on our social media platforms and
on
  <a href="http://www.3dprintingprofs.com/">
   our
website
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <ol bullettype="numbers">
  <li>
   <p>
    Record
     your short video introduction using a computer camera, cell phone camera,
     or any other recording device that will allow you to save a digital video
     to your computer. If you are using a cell phone, record the video holding the longer side of the phone parallel to the ground(landscape mode).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Save
     your video to your computer.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Go
     to
    <a href="http://youtube.com/">
     http://youtube.com
    </a>
    and
     create an account, if you don't already have one. If you do not wish to be
     identified, create a new account with a pseudonym. (Note: for those users
     who cannot access YouTube, there are a number of other video sites that
     will work for this assignment, such as
    <a href="http://www.tudou.com/">
     ToDou
    </a>
    or
    <a href="http://www.youku.com/">
     Youku
    </a>
    in China. However, the rest of these
     instructions are specific to YouTube.)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Sign
     in, and then click on the Upload button at the top of the page.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Click
     on the "Select files to upload" in the middle of the screen and
     then locate and click on your video to upload it.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Go to
     your "Video Manager" page.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Select
     the video you want to make “unlisted”. Click the "Edit" button
     to access the video's settings.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Go to
     the Privacy section of the page. There you'll see the option to mark your
     video as "unlisted", "public", or "private."
     Select "unlisted". By selecting "unlisted," your video
     will be hosted by YouTube but cannot be found by searching on YouTube;
     however, it will be accessible on Coursera once you embed a link.
    <strong>
     Be sure not to selecting
     "private", as that will prevent your classmates from seeing and
     reviewing your video.
    </strong>
    If you have problems with setting your video as
     "unlisted,”, see YouTube's
    <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=181547&amp;hl=en">
     help page.
    </a>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Click
     the "Save Changes" button. Once you've done this, your video
     will be an "unlisted" video. This is available only to people in
     this class. Please respect the privacy of others; do not share other
     people's URLs unless you have their written permission!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Copy
     the URL from your video and paste it into the URL field of the My
     submission tab.
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>

    (optional) If you would like to share your story with other learners on social media, use the URL and visit any of our
    <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-printing-revolution/supplement/1vga3/social-media">
     social media websites and share.
    </a>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Give
     your project a title and click on the Save or Preview button at the bottom
     of the page.
