[MUSIC] This concludes our course on
the 3D printing revolution. I hope that you learned some new concepts,
acquired some new tools, and heard some new stories. More importantly, I hope that this course enhanced your
understanding of how 3D printing works. And why this technology
revolutionized our economy. To wrap up, here are four key
lessons from this course. First, 3D printing is a new
low cost desktop technology that can be used by nearly anyone. Second, this technology allows us to
easily turn our ideas into objects and gives consumers the power to be creators. Third, 3D printing also blurs the divide
between the physical and the digital. It makes it easy to remix and
customize physical products. Fourth and finally by changing both the
roles of consumers the nature of objects, 3D printing will
revolutionize our economy. And change the way we live. There are many courses
in our specialization. We'll explore the 3D printing
ecosystem in more detail. The next course,
3D printing applications will examine how 3D printing is being used by large firms,
entrepreneurs and individuals to turn their ideas into objects and
to do things they couldn't do before. Thank you for
being part of our course community. I hope you enjoy the rest
of our specialization. [MUSIC]
